Charity Funding Predictor Neual Network Report <br/><br/>

1. Overview of the Analysis<br/>


2. Results <br/>

3. Summary <br/>
  The Neural Network Model did not achieve the goal of 75% accuracy. The best performance was 73.56% in the first optimization attempt. I would probably try a Feature Selection Model prior to developing the Neural Network Model in ordere to eliminate unnecessary features and hopefully obtain a better accuracy rate.
